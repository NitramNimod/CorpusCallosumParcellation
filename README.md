# Human Corpus Callosum Parcellation in MNI space

The Corpus Callosum (CC) is the largest white matter structure of the brain and offers the structural basis for an intense interaction between both cerebral hemispheres. Neuropathological processes are often reflected in structural alterations of the CC and a spatially precise description of structures for the healthy brain is essential for further differentiation of structural damage in patients.

M1 motor cortex:

Based on the Brainnetome Atlas four major regions of the M1 were used as seed regions for probabilistic tractography of inter-hemispherical structural connectivity.<br>
The available NIFTI files are organized as follows:<br>
A4hf - head/face movement region of the M1<br>
A4ll - lower limbs movement region of the M1<br>
A4tl - tongue/larynx movement region of the M1<br>
A4ul - upper limbs movement region of the M1<br>

For every callosal parcel different types exist:<br>
Four probability thresholds (0, 1%, 25%, 50%)<br>
Unmasked or multiplied by a binary mask of the Corpus Callosum.<br>
